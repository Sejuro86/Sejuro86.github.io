                                <p>First, thinly slice 4 slices of vidalia onion. Put those 4 slices in cold water for about
                                1 hour. In the food processor, put in 1/2 peeled korean pear(removed core), rest of the vidalia
                                onion and 3 cloves of garlic and ground them. Put 2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon
                                oligosaccharides syrup, 2 tablespoon italian mixed herbs, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1/2 tablespoon
                                ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon brown sugar into the processed
                                pear, garlic, onion mix and stir it well so they blend in nicely. Using the sauce mixture,
                                put in the 12oz. ground ribeye steak and knead it roughly. This roughly makes 2 patties.
                                As you shape the patty, make sure you throw it lightly from your hand to bowl. This process
                                makes the patty more denser. Shape and pan cook it to a medium rare on a high heat, or put
                                it into the pre heated oven at 400 degree farenheite for 8 to 10 minute. Slightly toast the
                                brioche buns, spread mayo on both sides of the bun. put 2 leaves of boston lettuce, patty,
                                slice of jalapeno jack cheese, 2 slices of vidalia onion, 2 slices of tomato, and ketchup
                                to finish it up. Serve it with cole-slaw or pickle.</p>
